	<p>
	Its been 2 years since i started dating a guy whom I gave him  all my  heart  and he  never never did  the same in return.
	He  started becoming wishy washy ,he don’t call me, he don’t want to see me, he don’t listen to what I say if he listen next time he can’t  remember what I said ,he don’t  respect my feelings  only to name a few. I felt I was in a toxic relationship. I always wanted to take a closure and love myself by I felt like he will change so I gave him time. </p>

	<p>He decided to breakup with me, I tried  racking my brain trying to figure out why he left me.I thought of  so many  reasons, but one thing for sure, if he was courageous enough  he would have told me why.  
	The only closure I ever need is understanding I deserve better, I decided to let it go, let him go,let him be. I am probably better off without him. I always say to myself   that life is better without him in it.
	I am not for him and he is not for me. It is not my fault that he feels am not enough or too much for him
	I may be intense and passionate or mild and sweet, maybe he just could not much my intensity or handle my sweetness.</p>
	<!-- <img src="images5/idw.gif"> -->
	<p>However I know I am good enough always I have been and always  be and to the one who will love me and accepts me  for who I am will see this. He has always  find me inadequate and	 he did not love me as much as I did to him.But This world is also filled with  people who can and  who will love me  fiercely .
	I am not for everyone and that is ok.

	I respect myself enough to let go of someone who doesn’t see my worth.It hurt so much loosing the one I love Its  heartbreaking.I  feel just void and emptiness.I find it difficult carrying my heart  with a huge hole in it,but I fill that space with love and I am gentle with it now that it is broken.</p>

	<p>I know it  will take time to heal but I am giving myself time to heal iam am allowing myself  to be sad,to grieve  and  to grow.This time is an oppotuity ,a moment.A chance to rebuid.Grow through what I am growing through.

	I am not sure where to start, I prefer starting from where I am,I am taking a step however feeble it is.
	I don’t want to compare myself with someones else’s jouney .This far I have realised how much stronger iam.It is not ok now by it  is going to be.I know the pain the  loneliness  and longing will come to pass its not here to stay.</p>


	<p>I know its not going to be easy  each passing day  but I will be stronger.I know things will work out,I will get better than what I have lossed.My heart will not stay broken,it will be whole again someday.I believe there is a happy ending to all of this ,someday someone will  come along and sweep  my feet and love me every inch of me-and appreciate me for my beauty,scars and bruises.Maybe my happy endings does include a guy,it could be just picking  up the brocken pieces of my heart,putting them back together  and starting over.Happy ending could just be me moving on.Best is yet to come.</p>
